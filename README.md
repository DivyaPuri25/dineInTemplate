# dineInTemplate
A simple pure HTML &amp; CSS template for a restaurant.

# How to contribute
The final aim is to create a responsive static webpage template for our restaurant named **DineIn** (That's not catchy but for now let it be :). There's no right or wrong here, this is just a place to learn. Pull requests are encouraged (But please don't make any meaningless pull requests like fixed a typo, capitalized the letter etc.)

* Fork this repo and clone it in your system.
* Code your way and commit.
* Create a pull request.

**Note that Git knowledge is mandatory here.**

## HTML5
Once you are done with the HTML5 section of ZTM course - Create the basic elements for our template such as restaurant menu, contact, about section etc.. (We are not worried about the looks for now)

## CSS
We will now add styles to our webpage once the CSS section of the ZTM course is done. Show your creativity here :)
